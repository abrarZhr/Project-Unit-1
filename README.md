# Project-Unit-1



This is the repo for my first project at Tuwaiq Academy, a website featuring 50 Disney characters

## built with :
1-HTML 
2-JavaScript
3-CSS
4-bootstrap
4-disney API


## Functionalities in the website: 
1-Add to favorite
2-show more information on the character

## I had a problem:
 1-API : a new topic for me that took a while to understand and how it works
2-Local storage with API: Fetching API data and linking to local storage took a while to understand

## Links:
API : https://disneyapi.dev/
